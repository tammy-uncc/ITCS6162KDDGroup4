## Description of data

### Data Understanding

### Data Preparation
Data contains 1389 negative diagnosis and 760 with a positive diagnosis.

##### Data  
- Ethnicity.  As it is, the data is highly biased towards caucasions.  Perhaps remove.
- Education level.  Remvoe as this seems irrelavent.  
- Smoking ???.  Data is highly weighted to non-smokers. Look to see if there is a correlation
- Family history. Also highly weighted.  Look for a correlation.
- Medical History items all seem weighted to the negatives for each of the conditions specified.  Perhaps look for a correlation.
- Memory complaints and Behavioral Problems seems to be a very subjective data element.  Perhaps these should be removed.
